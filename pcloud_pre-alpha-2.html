											These past two weeks of the studio project have been particularly hectic. Going through all this has been a lot of 
											work, and has involved a lot of painful lessons. As a testimony to how much work maintaining our current structure
											has been, I still don't feel that I'm doing nearly enough. There's no question that this experience has been 
											incredibly valuable, but for the sake of longevity, we may need to consider other structural options for the
											future once studio veterans begin to graduate.
										</p>
										<h3>Studio-wide & Leads Meetings</h3>
										<p>
											Much of this section is standard and very similar to the last sprint. Over the past 2 weeks, I've run 2 leads meetings, 
											each on Saturdays. The meeting on 2/27 was a typical ~2 hours, with 1 hour of prep time. However, the meeting on 3/6 
											lasted much longer. This is due to several reasons: namely, we had a long work session at its end to create tasks for 
											the Pre-Alpha III sprint, and also, an old studio lead (Nico Williams) spent quite a bit of time afterwards engaging in 
											additional discussion and providing advice.
										</p>
										<p>
											I may have forgotten to mention this in my previous dev-blog, but a new strategy I'm employing this semester involves 
											frequent retrospectives. An example of a 4-Ls retrospective done at a leads meeting this sprint is shown below.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/3-7-a.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											As for studio-wide meetings, these presentations were also standard and very similar to what I detailed in the previous 
											dev blog. As such, in the future, I won't go into as much detail on the process of preparing for and attending these. 
											However, I have embedded a progress video I recorded from mid Pre-Alpha II below.

										<h3>Creating a Sprint Plan & Design Sit-Down</h3>
										<p>
											A tremendous issue the studio has been facing this semester has been the communication of Design information to the
											rest of the studio. In previous semesters, this problem was not nearly as present. I've spent a lot of time deliberating
											over why this might be. Two big reasons off the top of my head are listed below:
											<ul>
												<li>Individual designers this semester have more control in fundamental project decisions now than ever. This means 
													members must often wait for vital decisions & documentation to be produced before being able to complete tasks, 
													because given that these choices lie with "regular" members (as opposed to leads, who are typically more committed),
													delays are significantly more frequent. 
												</li>
												<li>We're working off what is pretty much an entirely novel pitch this semester. As a result, there's no simple
													reference we can point people to when they're confused about the identity of Project Cloud. Instead, we can only
													direct them to our design documentation, which is mostly dense and text-heavy. I would generously assume that only
													around 40% of studio members are willingly caught up on our Design docs.
												</li>
											</ul>
											This presented multiple problems, the biggest of which being that practically nobody but our Designers felt comfortable 
											creating tasks. Our Design director became a central point of communication, which quickly became too much for one person.
											A central point of member-feedback was that tasks came out late and without sufficient descriptions in Jira. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Somewhat at a loss, I scheduled a meeting with Nico Williams and Matt Rader (two studio veterans - producer and design
											director, respectively, on multiple past studio projects) to discuss these issues and how I might be able to go about 
											resolving them from a production perspective. This meeting lasted several hours and was immensely helpful for clearing my
											head. From there, I was able to develop and execute an action plan.
										</p>
										<p>
											I discussed these issues at great length with our Design director for this semester, and we arranged a Design "sit-down" for
											studio leads. This took place in the evening on Friday 3/5, and contained a high-level overview of every mechanic and planned
											feature for Project Cloud, as well as a thorough description of minute-to-minute gameplay. This meeting was recorded and is 
											embedded below.
										</p>
										<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vmo5vhUubV797tcNjLHIZYIxEFtkIqmR/preview" width="800" height="500"></iframe>
										<p>
											In order to relieve the Design director of his tremendous burden in carrying and dispersing Design information, I spent 
											around 7 hours configuring Confluence, digging around our Design documentations, our Jira tasks, and our Bitbucket project. 
											The product of this was a very long Confluence page with specifically outline plans and projected tasks for our next sprint.
											This page can be found <a href="https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/x/IwhKAQ" target = "_blank">here</a>.
										</p>
										<p>
											A huge portion of time at the leads meeting after our Design sit-down took place was dedicated to having leads revise this 
											page and translate it into Jira tasks. Although our process was not perfect, I do believe it expedited and increased the
											efficiency of task creation by a great deal. I set an explicit expectation that, from now on, leads are to read the design
											documents posted in #design-preview regardless of whether or not the contents are directly related to their subsection of 
											the project. The hope is that leads will now remain caught up with the design of the project.
										</p>
										<h3>Leads 1 on 1s & Miscellaneous Meetings</h3>
										<p>
											Another component of my "action plan" has involved scheduling a weekly 30-minute sit-down with effectively every department
											director and pod lead of the studio. This week, I only went through 1 cycle of sit-downs (as they were instituted mid-sprint).
											These 1-1 check-ins occur on Wednesdays and Thursdays at the following times.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/3-7-b.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											I take extensive notes at this meetings to help keep updated with progress across the project. The notes for this sprint's 
											1 on 1 meetings can be found <a href="https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/x/sAdKAQ" target = "_blank">here</a> and
											<a href="https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/x/EQhKAQ" target = "_blank">here</a>. Although these do take quite a while
											to get through, they assist heavily in my overall knowledge of the project and ability to fulfill my role in production.
										</p>
										<p>
											I've also spent a lot of time listening in on various non-weekly meetings. For example, the enemies pod met in the evening on 
											Thursday 3/1 to discuss the second enemy's design, which I listened in on (both to make sure I was in the loop, and to take
											any questions if necessary). I make an effort to attend most meetings when possible. Another point of member feedback has been 
											a desire for more organized group work hours, so I scheduled the loose weekly hours of 8-10 PM ET on Mondays, Wednesdays, and 
											Fridays to serve as such. Although I wasn't able to make Monday or Friday last week, I stayed through 8-10 PM and after on 
											Wednesday with several others in our Working voice chat.
										</p>
										<h3>Player HUD & Other</h3>
										<p>
											Finally, I did spend quite a bit of time helping to mock-up a visual player HUD wit proper canvas scaling. Although my place
											isn't to do direct project work, I was able to help with setting this up for a few hours. The final result of my rough mock-up
											can be seen below. 
										</p>
										<p>
											I won't go through and list every little other thing I did this past 2 weeks, but among them include corresponding with absent
											members and the logistical overhead of arranging meetings and sending announcements. Although I don't count this as a studio 
											contribution (it is not reflected in my hours count), I was able to arrange and attend another meeting with Seven Siegel from 
											Epic Games. The possibility of doing an Unreal Engine game project in the summer grows larger, and the potential of establishing
											a precedent for collaboration between Unreal and the University of Michigan is excitingly real.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/3-7-c.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
										<p>
											I usually wouldn't include a section like this as this entry has gotten very long already, but I feel I'm not doing justice to
											describing the state of the project with what I've written above. The project is overall doing quite well, but we've encountered
											some severe setbacks along the way that are frankly still causing me a bit of concern.
										</p>
										<p>
											Several members have encountered severe git issues, most likely a result of commits made by members without git LFS installed. 
											This could call for a fix as drastic as migrating the project to a completely new repository. Additionally, several pods have 
											run into large and demoralizing problems. Due to a lapse in communication, our first enemy was created with scripts incompatible 
											with the Unity navmesh system; redoing these scripts caused a significant delay. Level design has also run into unexpectedly severe
											bugs as of late, which have continued to have a tremendously negative impact on the development of a closed gameplay loop. As a
											result, playtesting has also seen a major delay.
										</p>
										<p>
											Additionally, there continues to be a lack of art in the game as those who have the skills to import and hook up assets are 
											occupied with implementing other high priority fixes. This has slowed down the audio team, which relies on visual cues to properly 
											design and time sounds. 
										</p>
										<p>
											This doesn't even cover member drop-off, which inevitably tends to happen as midterms pick up and classes increase in difficulty.
											This has affected leads as well, meaning significant players in the project have had their hands tied with several other life
											priorities.
										</p>
										<p>
											As much as novel game pitches are a valuable experience for students to execute, with the chaos that has ensued from communciation 
											bottlenecks this semester, I'm much more inclined to lean back into the "case study" system we employed last semester (simply making
											a clone game rather than something original). I'm also sorely hurting from the fact that I didn't enforce the creation of a 90% loop 
											in the beginning of development as strongly as I should have. Along with that, I also wish I could've downscoped our project earlier. 
											As someone who's main goal has never been to go into production, I'm learning tremendously with each iteration of the studio, but I
											am constantly finding that I need to seriously focus on my assertiveness and proactivity in identifying and addressing problems earlier
											into projects.
										</p>
										<p>
											I have no doubt that the project will succeed as previous ones have - we've pulled ourselves out of much, much worse situations than
											this - but the process has most definitely not been painless. Even though I'm tired, I'm still optimistic. We did make the difficult
											decision of taking 1 week off the Gold phase and sticking it onto the end of Alpha as a "Pre-Alpha III" sprint to perform major
											bug fixes. I have faith that this decision, as well as the others I've detailed in this blog, will help get the project back on track.
