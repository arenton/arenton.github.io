										<h3>Studio-wide & Leads Meetings</h3>
										<p>
											For the first official week of production, much of the work I've done has been related to logistics and the overall
											transfer of information. This means that much of the work I did was managerial, and as a result, I did not directly
											touch the project repository.
										</p>
										<p>
											Over the past 2 weeks, I've run 2 leads meetings, each on Saturdays. These have lasted approximately 2 hours each. I
											have also spent roughly 1 hour each on planning both of these leads meetings by writing an in-depth agenda through 
											Confluence. An header of one meeting document can be seen, pictured below. Most agendas share a similar header, which 
											includes a list of goals for the meeting, a general studio timeline reminder, and a burndown chart for the current
											sprint.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/2-21-a.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Over the past 2 weeks, I've also run 3 studio-wide meetings. I've also monitored the discussion of the department and 
											pod meetings that continue after the end of the studio-wide segment. Other than the act of speaking at and attending
											these meetings, they also take several hours to plan. For each meeting, I record, edit, and upload a 2-4 minute video
											showcasing project progress. An example of one such video can be seen below. These meetings are recorded both for the 
											sake of keeping members updated on project progress, as well as for the sake of posterity.
										</p>

										<p>
											Each meeting also warrants its own individual set of slides, which include general announcements, reminders, and a
											showcase section that highlights member contributions. An example of a slide deck from the past 2 weeks (the eve of
											Pre-Alpha II, specifically) can be seen below.

										<h3>Server Maintenance, Communications, & Logistics</h3>
										<p>
											Over Pre-Alpha I, I also spent quite a bit of time configuring server bots to automate simple tasks. Among these
											include setting automatic studio and leads meeting reminders through Carl-bot. An example announcement can be seen 
											below.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/2-21-b.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											I also installed several Macros to our Confluence server, including one that makes for an easier 4-Ls Retrospective.
											Just for reference, 4-Ls retrospectives involve the team reflecting over the things they Loved, Longed for, Loathed,
											and Learned over a certain period of time (for us, over a sprint, or over a week).
											After receiving feedback about the value of retrospectives several times from past leads and members, I will now be 
											dedicating around 5-10 minutes at the end of every meeting to retrospectives. An example retrospective from a leads
											meeting during Pre-Alpha I can be seen below.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/2-21-c.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Over the Pre-Alpha I sprint, I have also been communicating with Matt Stone, a potential industry advisor. I have set
											up a meeting between him and the rest of the studio leads, during which he has kindly offered to give advice on our
											overall studio structure and progress. I've also reached out to and set up meetings with past studio leads, including 
											Nico Williams and Matt Rader, for advice on the current structure of the studio. The specific topic of these meetings
											will involve discussing the state of the Design department, as well as how we can more effectively communicate design 
											decisions, information, and updates to the rest of the studio.
										</p>
										<p>
											Another adventure that took place over Pre-Alpha I was the purchase of multiple 3D Unity Store asset packs with a 
											University of Michigan P-card with the help of Mariah Fiumara and Kate Killewald from the College of Engineering Office
											of Student Affairs. This process took place over several meetings due to technical issues. However, we were ultimately
											able to successfully purchase a 3D Creatures & Animations pack, as well as a 3D Diesel Punk Parts pack, which will 
											speed up our art pipelines very effectively. These are projected to be imported into the project early in Pre-Alpha II.
											A preview video of the 3D Creatures & Animations pack can be seen below - it will look awesome in Project Cloud, and many
											more studio projects to come!
