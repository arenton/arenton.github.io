										<h3>Studio-wide & Project Tower Meetings</h3>
										<p>
                                            There is so much stuff to talk about in this final devblog! I'll kick off by saying that meetings haven't been 
                                            much different this sprint. Same old, same old. I did arrange a small celebration for both projects for 
                                            Sunday 12/12, though, which was a really nice way to congratulate everyone for making it through another semester.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Project Tower UI Overhaul</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            In response to some feedback that we received in a playtest with Jordan Ajlouni, I made very significant UI changes
                                            which had been sitting in the backlog for ages. I also began fixing a few minor things that I felt seriously took 
                                            away from the professionalism of the game.
                                        </p>
                                        <video width="600" controls>
                                            <source src="images/Devblog/12-12-b.mp4" type=video/mp4>
                                        </video>
                                        <p>
                                            In the video above, we have an intermediary glimpse of some of the first changes I made:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Previously, the tower range icon was just a default Unity circle that turned neon red and neon green, depending 
                                                on whether or not you could place a tower there. It was pretty painful to see. I changed it to a softer grey
                                                circle, reminiscent of the tower range display from Bloons TD 6.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The tower description text used to overflow all the time. Also a little painful, especially for first-time 
                                                playtesters.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                There used to be a LOT of negative space in the Tower selection UI, which made it feel as though something were
                                                missing. I changed out the background sprite entirely (it used to be a black rectangle) and began experimenting
                                                with a more interesting shape/color. As you can see above, it's not exactly themed with the rest of the game at
                                                this point, so I do end up changing it further later.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                I removed dynamic spawning altogether from the tower actions screen. Given that each tower is guaranteed to have 
                                                two upgrades, and each tower is guaranteed to have a sell button, it really makes no sense that these buttons are
                                                instantiated at runtime. The system itself is understandable, but for our purposes, it was a lot easier to make 
                                                aesthetic changes after I made everything static.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            But of course, the above wasn't it. Game UI is really tricky to get right, because the smallest things can make an 
                                            otherwise excellent game look amateur-ish. This is - of course - subjective, but I felt that we could do even better.
                                            Thus, we step into discussion on "part 2" of the UI overhaul.
                                        </p>
                                        <video width="600" controls>
                                            <source src="images/Devblog/12-12-c.mp4" type=video/mp4>
                                        </video>
                                        <p>
                                            Disclaimer - I didn't touch the main menu at all (I only mention this as the video above briefly displays the main
                                            menu). I completely changed the visual theming of the UI, both in-game and in our narrative scenes. I moved in the 
                                            direction of stone tablets, which I felt was appropriate with the Norse-inspired visual of our game (with rune stones
                                            and what-not). I also moved certain elements of the UI around, such as the pause and play buttons, in an attempt to 
                                            make their placement more intuitive. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Additionally, I made a small change that updates tower portrait art with tower upgrade purchases (this way, we can 
                                            see all of our artists' work)! I added tooltips to the tower purchase screen to make them a bit more readable.
                                            Finally, I enforced some consistency in our font choice. Whilst performing these UI changes, I also added small 
                                            visual tweaks (such as a few new 2D lights) and integrated some final art assets into the game.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While the end product certainly isn't close to perfect, I do think the experience feels a bit more polished as a 
                                            result of these changes. For reference, this is what the UI looked like before these changes:
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/12-12-d.JPG" alt="" /></a>
                                        <h3>Final Narrative Art</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            There's not too much to say here, other than that I finalized the narrative portrait art for Revna and Yrsa!
                                            Revna looks very similar (but a lot less sketchy). I made some big changes to Yrsa, as I wasn't very proud of how 
                                            her sketch came out. I gave both characters a couple different expressions.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Cover Art</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            And now to discuss the star of the show - the cover art(s)!
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Ragnarok TD</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            As I had already blocked out two (messy) key art pieces for Project Bloom, I decided to first focus my attention on 
                                            Project Tower. I didn't have much in mind other than that I wanted to focus on the three gods we managed to represent
                                            in the game: Thor, Freyja, and Sunna.
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/12-12-f.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <p>
                                            Typically, I create a detailed sketch before I move into cover art. This time, though, I was in a bit of a rush, and 
                                            so I jumped straight into inked lines. It somewhat messed with the anatomy, but I think we can smoothly play it off 
                                            as stylization! After lining the art, I colored it, and then made some color adjustments.
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/12-12-g.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/12-12-a.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <p>
                                            The title art (Ragnarok TD with the wings) was a little rushed on my end. I threw something together very quickly 
                                            in Adobe Illustrator. I think it works, but it wasn't very well thought out. Also, as a fun aside, I ended up doing 
                                            some quick animation of the cover art for the trailer using Adobe After Effects. Take a look below.
                                        </p>

                                        </video>
                                        <h4>
                                            Bloom: Roots of Renewal
                                        </h4>
                                        <p>
                                            I wish I could have spent a bit more time on the cover art for Bloom. After I blocked out the first potential 
                                            cover art concept, the team asked that I block out the second so that they could compare. Both drafts can be 
                                            seen below (but only the red-orange one was created this sprint).
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/11-28-a.png" alt="" /></a>

                                        <p>
                                            After comparing the two images, the Bloom team preferred the red-orange one (the one on the bottom). I definitely
                                            agree that it captures the overall vibe of the game a bit better (and the composition is more dynamic). After
                                            wrapping up the trailer and cover art for Ragnarok TD, I went back in and polished their preferred cover art.
                                            Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do this before the team registered for the showcase. The polished cover art 
                                            can be seen below. I'm not the biggest fan of how it looks, but it did come out okay.

                                        <h3>Ragnarok TD Trailer</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Very kindly, Jackson volunteered to do the Bloom trailer, and so I was able to focus only on the Ragnarok TD 
                                            trailer. This was a tremendous help.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I knew that I wanted to include elements of narrative in the trailer, and so I recreated a small part of the 
                                            opening cutscene. I created two 2D art slides for this (credits to Zelin for the background of the first one).

                                        <video width="600" controls>
                                            <source src="images/Devblog/12-12-l.mp4" type=video/mp4>
                                        </video>
                                        <p>
                                            I'm very much not a fan of how the second slide turned out, but given time constraints, I couldn't go back in to
                                            fix it up. I then put the trailer together using some of the beautiful backing tracks by our audio team, as well 
                                            as a couple CC0 sound effects from freesound.org. The final trailer looks like this:

                                        <h3>Itch Pages</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Finally, I set up Ragnarok TDs itch page (and also made some small modifications to the Bloom itch page).

                                                <li><a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/ragnarok-td" target="_blank">Ragnarok TD page</a></li>

                                            We're doing very well on itch.io right now, making it into the top 5 through top 20 of a few tags! It's always really
                                            exciting to share this kind of news with members. A huge thank you to Paul for helping me record a ton of GIFs of 
                                            Project Tower.

                                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            So, this is it! My final devblog in WolverineSoft Studio. It's been incredible to be a part of something so special
                                            for so long. The studio has grown so much since Dreamwillow, and so have I. No words can describe how it felt to step 
                                            out of the BBB for the last time after a studio meeting! I'm so moved by the amazing people I've been able to work 
                                            with and get to know over the past 3 years.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            With George and I graduating, everyone who was a part of the studio's conception is gone. Goodbye to an era, and
                                            a huge welcome to this new chapter! I can't wait to see how the studio - and how game development at Michigan - will
                                            grow.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Thank you so much for everything that you do. It's meant so much to me. If I can ever give back to the community and 
                                            to the people who have given me so much, always know that I'll jump at the opportunity.
                                        </p>
