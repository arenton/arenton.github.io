										<h3>Studio-wide & Project Tower Meetings</h3>
										<p>
                                            There is so much stuff to talk about in this final devblog! I'll kick off by saying that meetings haven't been 
                                            much different this sprint. Same old, same old. I did arrange a small celebration for both projects for 
                                            Sunday 12/12, though, which was a really nice way to congratulate everyone for making it through another semester.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Project Tower UI Overhaul</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            In response to some feedback that we received in a playtest with Jordan Ajlouni, I made very significant UI changes
                                            which had been sitting in the backlog for ages. I also began fixing a few minor things that I felt seriously took 
                                            away from the professionalism of the game.
                                        </p>
                                        <video width="600" controls>
                                            <source src="images/Devblog/12-12-b.mp4" type=video/mp4>
                                        </video>
                                        <p>
                                            In the video above, we have an intermediary glimpse of some of the first changes I made:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Previously, the tower range icon was just a default Unity circle that turned neon red and neon green, depending 
                                                on whether or not you could place a tower there. It was pretty painful to see. I changed it to a softer grey
                                                circle, reminiscent of the tower range display from Bloons TD 6.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The tower description text used to overflow all the time. Also a little painful, especially for first-time 
                                                playtesters.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                There used to be a LOT of negative space in the Tower selection UI, which made it feel as though something were
                                                missing. I changed out the background sprite entirely (it used to be a black rectangle) and began experimenting
                                                with a more interesting shape/color. As you can see above, it's not exactly themed with the rest of the game at
                                                this point, so I do end up changing it further later.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                I removed dynamic spawning altogether from the tower actions screen. Given that each tower is guaranteed to have 
                                                two upgrades, and each tower is guaranteed to have a sell button, it really makes no sense that these buttons are
                                                instantiated at runtime. The system itself is understandable, but for our purposes, it was a lot easier to make 
                                                aesthetic changes after I made everything static.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            But of course, the above wasn't it. Game UI is really tricky to get right, because the smallest things can make an 
                                            otherwise excellent game look amateur-ish. This is - of course - subjective, but I felt that we could do even better.
                                            Thus, we step into discussion on "part 2" of the UI overhaul.
                                        </p>
                                        <video width="600" controls>
                                            <source src="images/Devblog/12-12-c.mp4" type=video/mp4>
                                        </video>
                                        <p>
                                            Disclaimer - I didn't touch the main menu at all (I only mention this as the video above briefly displays the main
                                            menu). I completely changed the visual theming of the UI, both in-game and in our narrative scenes. I moved in the 
                                            direction of stone tablets, which I felt was appropriate with the Norse-inspired visual of our game (with rune stones
                                            and what-not). I also moved certain elements of the UI around, such as the pause and play buttons, in an attempt to 
                                            make their placement more intuitive. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Additionally, I made a small change that updates tower portrait art with tower upgrade purchases (this way, we can 
                                            see all of our artists' work)! I added tooltips to the tower purchase screen to make them a bit more readable.
                                            Finally, I enforced some consistency in our font choice. Whilst performing these UI changes, I also added small 
                                            visual tweaks (such as a few new 2D lights) and integrated some final art assets into the game.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While the end product certainly isn't close to perfect, I do think the experience feels a bit more polished as a 
                                            result of these changes. For reference, this is what the UI looked like before these changes:
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/12-12-d.JPG" alt="" /></a>
                                        <h3>Final Narrative Art</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            There's not too much to say here, other than that I finalized the narrative portrait art for Revna and Yrsa!
                                            Revna looks very similar (but a lot less sketchy). I made some big changes to Yrsa, as I wasn't very proud of how 
                                            her sketch came out. I gave both characters a couple different expressions.
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/12-12-e.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <h3>Cover Art</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The star of the show - the cover art!
