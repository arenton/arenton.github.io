                Tileset Iteration and Windmill Forts
            </h3>

            <p class = "b2">
                Throughout the past three weeks, I've worked heavily on environment art as well
                as on various Production tasks. I was initially upset with the quality of my 
                Crystal Caves tile set, as I felt it got repetitive very quickly. Levels looked
                very bland, and there was little contrast (see my previous blog post for evidence).
                As a result, I expanded heavily on the tile set by taking inspiration from the variety
                tiles in Celeste. First, I created tiles for the "breakable wall" level obstacle and
                replaced the old "spikes" tile with something more muted that looked more cohesive 
                with the environment.
                <br><br>
                <div style = "float:left">
                    <img src = "img/ltp20/breakableWall1.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:2%">
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <img src = "img/ltp20/newvsoldspikes.png" style = "float:left;width:60%;margin:1%">
                </div>
            </p>
            <p class = "b2">
                After this, I began working on variety tiles. Pictured below is a "summary" of the old tile
                set, minus any crystal decorations and alternate tiles.
                <br><br>
                <img src = "img/ltp20/oldTiles.png" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                What these tiles lack are what I call "inner" tiles. Here is a screenshot of a level created
                with this tile set. It is difficult to see, and implementation of the tile set isn't finished
                in this screenshot, but it becomes obvious that there are tiles missing.
                <br><br>
                <img src = "img/ltp20/oldTileLevel.PNG" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                To remedy this, I created the below 4 "inner tiles".
                <br><br>
                <img src = "img/ltp20/innerTiles.png" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                From there, I combined all these elements to create a completely new tile set with just as many
                alternate tiles to serve as a "variety" tile set. Tiles from both tile sets could be combined
                with one another seamlessly to create a varied and interesting level. A screen cap of the new
                tile set is pictured below. The darker tiles on the left are old (asides from the breakable wall),
                and the tiles on the right are completely new.
                <br><br>
                <img src = "img/ltp20/newtiles.PNG" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                I also created an example level in Illustrator to showcase how this new tile set would look.
                <br><br>
                <img src = "img/ltp20/examplelevel.PNG" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                My final task this sprint was to create a parallax-able first iteration draft of the Windmill
                Forts background. Because we are currently reworking the way parallax works for a smoother
                experience (my task for the next sprint), this doesn't reflect the actual sprites that will
                appear in-game. However, it is enough to get an idea of what will be done in the next two weeks.

                Crystal Caves Level Design
            </h3>
            <p class = "b1">
                March 1st, 2020 | Amber Renton | WolverineSoft Studio
            </p>
            <p class = "b2">
                During these past two weeks, I've been focusing on my work in the level design
                team. Before jumping into getting art assets out for the Crystal Caves, There
                were multiple questions we had to answer first: (1) How large was each tile with
                respect to the player sprite? (2) How complex did we want tiles to be relative
                to their background art? (3) What are the factors that we must consider for
                parallax? We ultimately determined that, much like in Celeste, Io would be 2 tiles
                tall with a collider of only 1 tile. We also determined that tiles would look simple
                in order to avoid the screen from getting too chaotic, and that for now, background
                images should tile for simple and rapid parallax. 
                <br><br>
                <img src = "img/ltp20/keyconcept.png" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                As pictured, I already had a key concept in place for the appearance of
                a Crystal Caves level. However, this was only a draft, and the piece wasn't cleanly
                broken up into different parallax-able layers. Additionally, each "layer" of this 
                piece wasn't tile-able horizontally. 
                <br><br>
                Thus, my next course of action was to go through this illustration file and manually
                separate it into layers. After doing that, I had to go back through and tile each layer
                with itself and make the necessary adjustments to make each piece horizontally tile-able
                for a clean parallax. While this was fairly tedious work and took quite a while, the
                results were pretty satisfying and each layer can be viewed below.
            </p>
            <div style = "float:left">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/1.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/2.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/3.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/4.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/5.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/6.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">
            </div>
            <p class = "b2">
                The finished product looked like this:
                <img src = "img/ltp20/fullbgpreview.png" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                <br><br>
                After finishing up with the Crystal Caves background, I then moved into the phase of
                planning out its tileset. This proved to be difficult, as my original key concept art
                did not show off much of a "tileset". Additionally, it was still up in the air as to
                how much lighting would be done in-sprite as opposed to in-Unity with tools such as
                normal maps. Before creating any final assets, I drafted a potential "block" in my 
                illustration software to test color palettes and general design. This would be a
                potential platform tile.
                <img src = "img/ltp20/tileexample.png" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                After reviewing the image, I drafted vector final sprites based on this tile in Adobe 
                Illustrator. I took care to ensure that it tiled nicely.

                <img src = "img/ltp20/CrystalCaves-27.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/CrystalCaves-26.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">

            </div>
            <p class = "b2">
                Then, I created other tiles with colors featured in the keyconcept. While these are not 
                final, I wanted to see how these tiles looked in-game before making more detailed sprites.
            </p>

                <img src = "img/ltp20/CrystalCaves-0.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">

            <p class = "b2">
                Not all are shown! There are a total of 30 sprites so far, and it's likely that even
                more will be needed per level. I was also asked to create additional sprites to serve
                not as platforms but as decorations, so I created some crystal sprites. I was also 
                asked to create "hazard" sprites, so I opted to create pointier crystals.
            </p>
            <div style = "float:left">
                <img src = "img/ltp20/CrystalCaves-21.png" style = "float:left;width:30%;margin:1%">

            </div>
            <p class = "b2">
                I find myself not so much a fan of the saturated colors of these sprites, however. 
                Even with these many tiles, the level still grows repetitive.
                <br><br>
                After helping other level design artists understand how to create smoothly tile-able
                tile palettes, my next steps will be to add and refine even more tiles and foreground
                adornments to the Crystal Cave level before moving on to drafting similar things for
                the Windmill Forts and other planned environments. Similar to my work in Dreamwillow,
                I've found Level Design art to be one of the most work-heavy teams in the project, and
                I'm concerned about what this might mean for scope. I intend to use Spring Break to 
                put out a lot of art assets for Project Blue, however, so as of now I am not too worried.

            <h3>
                Style Guide, Tutorials, and Key Concepts
            </h2>
            <p class = "b1">
                February 17th, 2020 | Amber Renton | WolverineSoft Studio
            </p>
            <p class = "b2">
                As the past two weeks have wrapped up the pre-production and pre-alpha phases,
                I've been working on wrapping up the first iteration of the studio style guide,
                pushing out some tutorials, and illustrating key concept art for other art 
                members and teams to reference. 
                <br><br>
                The questions that are asked of me most consistently are about visual theming.
                Without a central theme, it's difficult to put together a cohesive looking, 
                sounding, and feeling game. These questions are what I attempted to answer through
                the Style Guide, which is posted on Confluence under the Departments > Art folder.
                <img src = "img/ltp20/styleguide1.png" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                <br><br>
                Pictured above are a few of the vital snippets of the Style Guide. I also included
                an introduction to sprite architecture - that is, how a sprite should be separated
                into layers when created. I also discussed the gap in style between the game's 
                foreground and background.
                <br><br>
                Another task I tackled this week was the creation of the Studio's Unity 2D Animation 
                Tutorial. I actually had to try to record this twice as the first iteration was too
                laggy. In the end, it became - with no exaggeration - about 16 hours of grueling work,
                planning, recording, and narrating. Even still, the video is not in its ideal state. 
                For now, though, it has been uploaded to the Studio YouTube channel. The video can be
                accessed <a href = "https://youtu.be/nfdhyLFyZnw">here</a>.
                <img src = "img/ltp20/animtutorial.png" style = "float:left;width:100%;margin:1%">
                <br><br>
                In order to evaluate the feasibility of our desired art style, as well as to identify
                a key aesthetic for Project Blue, I worked with Alex Kisil's creative direction to 
                illustrate a "key concept" for the Crystal Caves. I also created two iterations of
                concept art for Io, which I let Alex Kisil and the other leads choose from. I began
                a rough draft of the Crystal Caves tile set, which should be done next week.
