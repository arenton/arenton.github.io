											The final push! This past sprint, I've done a lot more hands-on work than usual in order to make up for member absence.
											Now that development has officially come to a close, I feel a lot more comfortable discussing my thoughts on the project 
											as a whole, as well as what can be done in the future.
										</p>
										<h3>Studio-wide & Leads Meetings</h3>
										<p>
											The leads meetings this sprint became shorter as our goals became more clear. We followed the fairly straightforward format
											of playtesting off of development, discussing the state of the game, identifying tasks, and discussing any last minute topics
											at the end. I plan on scheduling a post-mortem with the leads within the next few weeks (but after the semester ends).
										</p>
										<p>
											Preparing for the final studio-wide meeting was slightly more work intensive than other meetings. I created a member feedback
											form, finalized the summer studio application, and recorded the final "progress" video. As per usual, it can be seen before.
										</p>
										<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOPWKlrQKBQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>
											It was a little unfortunate to capture bugs and clearly unfinished work in the final progress video, but it is what it is.
											Although I've only ever recorded progress videos for Circuitry and Project Cloud, the stark difference between the final videos
											for both games is telling. Somehow, Project Cloud fell uniquely behind this semester. I have a few thoughts on why that may be,
											but I will save those for later.
										</p>
										<h3>Cover Art</h3>
										<p>
											I sinked at least 20 hours into working on the cover art this sprint. Not an exaggeration. It took so long because (1), I
											was trying a new Hades-esque style that was VERY far out of my comfort zone, and (2), I wanted to make a really good first 
											impression with the cover art. It took a lot of disappointment, but I ended up with something I'm really proud of. Take a look
											at the progress below:
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-a.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											(above) This was the state of the cover art a little after the progress picture I gave last week. I experimented a lot with 
											pen pressure in the lineart. If we examine the Hades cover art, we see a lot of thick, black shadows throughout. I wanted to 
											imitate that intense look, so I added similar shadows to Hermes.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-b.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											(above) This is what Hermes looked like after being colored. Coloring took a LONG, especially on the Caduceus itself. Getting
											a metallic look is very challenging. It was a lot of throwing down contrasted dark and light colors and hoping they looked shiny
											and nice together.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-c.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											(above) This is what the background was GOING to look like. Not gonna lie, it took me a very, very long time to come up with 
											a suitable background. A problem I frequently run into is rushing into an art piece without considering the background, which 
											also messes up my ability to do nice lighting. The shading on the background stood out far too much compared to the shading on 
											Hermes, which made this particular iteration of the environment very weak, in my opinion.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-d.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											(above) After much deliberation, I settled on a more cell-shaded background. This didn't clash as much with Hermes, but it looked
											very dull and lifeless due to the lack of color. And our game is <i>definitely</i> not dull and lifeless. So while this was a step
											in the right direction, it still felt very incomplete.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-e.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											So, I elected to add in a splash of pink-blue color to the sky, similar to the skybox we actually see in-game. I had to use the
											curves tool in Adobe Photoshop quite a few times on various elements in the background to get the colors cohesive.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-f.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											A few minor adjustments later, adding some more polish and contrast to a few places, and adding a title to the image, we get the 
											final product! I created several different resolutions for members to use on their portfolios, all of which can be
											<a href = "https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/x/nAtKAQ">viewed here.</a>
										</p>
										<h3>Itch Page</h3>
										<p>
											Along the same lines as the cover art, I spent quite a while getting the itch page to look good. This involved separating the
											background of the cover art for the background art of the itch page, creating several new "header" images for the body of the itch 
											page, and recording a ton of gifs of gameplay. I'm very happy with how the results turned out - in fact, I'd even say that this is 
											my favorite itch page I've designed! The itch page may be <a href = "https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/caduceus">viewed here.</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											I did almost create a quick trailer for Caduceus, but I unfortunately had several looming deadlines from other classes that I needed
											to take care of. I may go back and create one for the future. In the mean time, I've submitted Caduceus, Circuitry, Bloom, and
											Desolation Place to the SGDA 2021 Summit. I'm looking forward to hearing which entries (if any) have been accepted!
										</p>
										<h3>Other</h3>
										<p>
											I also spent quite a bit of time scaling the player HUD with the Unity canvas system, but unfortunately another programmer made
											changes at the same time, and we ended up with a merge conflict. The resolution of the merge conflict essentially overwrote all my
											work, which was a big bummer. As a result, the player HUD in the final game doesn't quite scale properly (though it does look very 
											nice now).
										</p>
										<p>
											I was also able to schedule a call with Brian Mitchell from Unreal, a member of the Epic Games internship team. We discussed 
											the possibility of him giving a talk at the start of the group Unreal learning session to get everyone hyped up. I also mentioned 
											the possiblility of a 494-WolverineSoft-ARI midwest game development summit at the end of Fall 2021, and he mentioned that Unreal 
											recruiters may be interested in attending and potentially offering internships to students. Nothing definitive, but I'll definitely
											be keeping in touch with him.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition, I scheduled a ~2 hour talk with the studio directors to discuss the summer project. There, we solidified timelines,
											membership selection, and a few other details. We'll be meeting again soon to talk team size. The Unreal group learning materials
											will be mostly finished by early May, and preproduction for the summer project will begin on May 23rd. Applications for both the 
											Summer and Fall 2021 have finally been released.
										</p>
										<h3>Retrospective</h3>
										<p>
											It's a little difficult to talk about Caduceus, largely because of burnout. The studio took such an unusually tremendous amount of
											time for me this time around compared to previous runs that it's felt really tiring to encounter setbacks through development.
											If I could name just a few things that I believe have made this semester of the studio uniquely difficult, it would be the following:
											<ul>
												<li>
													Overly ambitious project. I should have been much more skeptical when the idea of Project Cloud was introduced. This, of course,
													isn't to say that the project plan wasn't super cool and nicely designed. It was my role to notice that certain intended features,
													such as a skill tree, procedural generation, etc. would've taken up a huge amount of time without adding much to the project, but 
													I was too easily persuaded into thinking our team could take on the challenge. As a "veteran" lead, it fell on me and no one else
													to realize this. This is definitely a rough lesson that I will keep in mind for the future.
												</li>
												<li>
													Lack of coordination with industry advisors. Because I wasn't necessarily "next in line" as studio director when I came into the 
													position, and had to take up the role rather suddenly, I think I missed out on a lot of valuable mentorship (which is no one's
													fault, just an unfortunate situation). As a result, I had NO idea how frequently that our past leads communicated with industry 
													mentors, and I was never really introduced to any of our previous mentors. I thus did not set up meetings with any industry
													advisors early on, which meant we missed out on valuable insight. If we had their help, they might have noticed the flaws in our
													project scope much earlier than we did. In the future, I'll absolutely be coordinating with them more.
												</li>
												<li>
													Lack of "true" Agile. I don't think we've ever been able to perfectly approximate an Agile workflow before, but this semester in 
													particular was much more similar to Waterfall than anything. In any case, we should have had a complete game loop by the second
													sprint at the latest. Instead, a huge amount of feature creep resulted in us not having a complete game loop until near the final
													weeks of development, which was highly detrimental to morale and playtesting as a whole.
												</li>
