											The final push! This past sprint, I've done a lot more hands-on work than usual in order to make up for member absence.
											Now that development has officially come to a close, I feel a lot more comfortable discussing my thoughts on the project 
											as a whole, as well as what can be done in the future.
										</p>
										<h3>Studio-wide & Leads Meetings</h3>
										<p>
											The leads meetings this sprint became shorter as our goals became more clear. We followed the fairly straightforward format
											of playtesting off of development, discussing the state of the game, identifying tasks, and discussing any last minute topics
											at the end. I plan on scheduling a post-mortem with the leads within the next few weeks (but after the semester ends).
										</p>
										<p>
											Preparing for the final studio-wide meeting was slightly more work intensive than other meetings. I created a member feedback
											form, finalized the summer studio application, and recorded the final "progress" video. As per usual, it can be seen before.
										</p>
										<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOPWKlrQKBQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>
											It was a little unfortunate to capture bugs and clearly unfinished work in the final progress video, but it is what it is.
											Although I've only ever recorded progress videos for Circuitry and Project Cloud, the stark difference between the final videos
											for both games is telling. Somehow, Project Cloud fell uniquely behind this semester. I have a few thoughts on why that may be,
											but I will save those for later.
										</p>
										<h3>Cover Art</h3>
										<p>
											I sinked at least 20 hours into working on the cover art this sprint. Not an exaggeration. It took so long because (1), I
											was trying a new Hades-esque style that was VERY far out of my comfort zone, and (2), I wanted to make a really good first 
											impression with the cover art. It took a lot of disappointment, but I ended up with something I'm really proud of. Take a look
											at the progress below:
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-4-b.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											I posted this in #art-preview for feedback, and reception was generally positive. I did receive some feedback in an art 
											meeting that Hermes' left arm (the one not holding the Caduceus) is in a bit of an awkward spot, so I did a quick iteration 
											to put it in a slightly more sensible place.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-4-c.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											I've begun lining the art, but to be completely honest, I am not satisfied with the linework so far. I'm going for a very 
											Hades-esque style (by Hades, I'm referring to the indie game that came out recently), which is very much not something I'm 
											used to. Below is a work in progress shot of the lineart that I am very-not-proud-of. I promise, it'll look better when it's
											done!
										</p>

										<h3>Animation Assistance</h3>
										<p>
											Another thing I helped the art team out with these past two weeks has been setting up and debugging animations. The enemy 
											animations have been pretty awkward so far - we have these awesome, 3rd party animations, but hooking them up properly has 
											been very difficult. I volunteered to take another look at what was causing the animations for the Charger and the Shooter 
											to go haywire. This entailed going through both of their animators, as well as making some adjustments through code. Very
											standard, but the most interesting thing I did was rework the Shooter attack into a separate public function (it sounds
											simple, but it was tangled up with a lot of other code). In doing this, I was able to create an animation event on its 
											"shoot" animation that spawned its projectile. Prior to this, the projectile spawned independent of the animation, making it 
											appear very off-time. It may not be very clearly visible below, but you can see the animation event on the Shooter's shooting
											animation.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-4-e.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											I also set up a very basic iteration of the animator for the Flying enemy (the Phoenix). It's due to change a lot - I wasn't 
											able to test it as the Flyer isn't implemented yet - but I learned a bit about animation layers along the way.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-4-f.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
										<p>
											I had a pretty relaxing time over the past 2 weeks. It's a bit selfish, but it's nice to be doing some direct work on the
											project lately - this kind of thing is much more up my alley than production. In these final two weeks, I imagine production 
											work will continue to be fairly minimal. Thus, I'll be turning my focus to some "marketing" work (cover art, title art, the 
											trailer, project title, etc) as well as planning for the summer project. The next dev blog, I believe, is the last, so I will 
											aim to type up a comprehensive post-mortem of the past semester. For now, I'm optimistic, and am excited for these final two
											weeks of development.
