											The final push! This past sprint, I've done a lot more hands-on work than usual in order to make up for member absence.
											Now that development has officially come to a close, I feel a lot more comfortable discussing my thoughts on the project 
											as a whole, as well as what can be done in the future.
										</p>
										<h3>Studio-wide & Leads Meetings</h3>
										<p>
											The leads meetings this sprint became shorter as our goals became more clear. We followed the fairly straightforward format
											of playtesting off of development, discussing the state of the game, identifying tasks, and discussing any last minute topics
											at the end. I plan on scheduling a post-mortem with the leads within the next few weeks (but after the semester ends).
										</p>
										<p>
											Preparing for the final studio-wide meeting was slightly more work intensive than other meetings. I created a member feedback
											form, finalized the summer studio application, and recorded the final "progress" video. As per usual, it can be seen before.
										</p>
										<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOPWKlrQKBQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>
											It was a little unfortunate to capture bugs and clearly unfinished work in the final progress video, but it is what it is.
											Although I've only ever recorded progress videos for Circuitry and Project Cloud, the stark difference between the final videos
											for both games is telling. Somehow, Project Cloud fell uniquely behind this semester. I have a few thoughts on why that may be,
											but I will save those for later.
										</p>
										<h3>Cover Art</h3>
										<p>
											I sinked at least 20 hours into working on the cover art this sprint. Not an exaggeration. It took so long because (1), I
											was trying a new Hades-esque style that was VERY far out of my comfort zone, and (2), I wanted to make a really good first 
											impression with the cover art. It took a lot of disappointment, but I ended up with something I'm really proud of. Take a look
											at the progress below:
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-a.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											(above) This was the state of the cover art a little after the progress picture I gave last week. I experimented a lot with 
											pen pressure in the lineart. If we examine the Hades cover art, we see a lot of thick, black shadows throughout. I wanted to 
											imitate that intense look, so I added similar shadows to Hermes.
										</p>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/4-18-b.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											(above) This is what Hermes looked like after being colored. Coloring took a LONG, especially on the Caduceus itself. Getting
											a metallic look is very challenging. It was a lot of throwing down contrasted dark and light colors and hoping they looked shiny
											and nice together.
