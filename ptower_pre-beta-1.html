										<h3>Studio-wide & Project Tower Meetings</h3>
										<p>
                                            This past sprint was a bit of an anomaly. I prepared two meetings - one for 11/07, and one for 11/14. However, due to my
                                            overnight shift for the Turkey Jam over the night between 11/13 and 11/14, Nikhil helped run the 11/14 meeting in my 
                                            place. Additionally, our 11/14 meeting was remote (also due to the Turkey Jam). Otherwise, our meetings went as usual.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Art Work</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            I spent a large amount of time this sprint doing artwork. Our artists have been doing phenomenal work, although we have seen
                                            a slight bit of dropoff from our initial momentum (as is normal for this time in the semester). I worked with Crystal, the
                                            coordinator of our narrative team, in designing two narrative portrait drafts. I believe I showed off Yrsa (the old lady)
                                            last sprint; the new character is Revna, a defiant little girl. They can both be seen before. I'm satisfied with Revna's
                                            design, but Yrsa may change a bit in her final sprite. Additionally, I'll be paying closer attention to Zelin's art style
                                            when I finalize these sprites to see if I can maintain a bit of stylistic cohesion.
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/11-14-a.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <p>
                                            Something that ate up a huge chunk of time was finalizing our level art for all 3 levels. Lucy did incredible work with her
                                            drafts for all 3 levels. Due to time constraints, I took over finalizing her drafts this sprint. They can be seen below
                                            (in order of in-game appearance):
                                        </p> 
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/11-14-b.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/11-14-c.PNG" alt="" /></a>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/11-14-d.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <p>
                                            I also integrated these assets into the game, which took a considerable amount of time. In accordance with the systems set
                                            up by our programmers, I had to carefully place colliders matching the geometry of both the paths and the environmental
                                            obstacles for all 3 levels. I also went through and added some "finishing touches", including simple snow particles, 2D
                                            lights, and a custom water shader. The final result can be seen below:
                                        </p>
                                        <video width="600" controls>
                                            <source src="images/Devblog/11-14-e.mp4" type=video/mp4>
                                        </video>
                                        <p>
                                            <br>
                                            Overall, I think this did a lot in terms of bringing Project Tower from looking to be in its early stages to being more
                                            reminiscent of a game that will be finished soon. There are several more art tasks that need to be completed by the end
                                            of development, but things are shaping up nicely!
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Programming & Design Work</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            I also completed quite a few programming and design related tasks this sprint. Among these tasks included an in-game 
                                            representation of "bulk" enemies (such as Rainbow balloons, which break into other smaller balloons when destroyed), 
                                            a balancing pass on enemy speed, and an in-game representation of MOABs. The only remaining "balloon" type that we will
                                            be implementing is the camoflauged type.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Thanks to the excellent work of other programmers and designers on this team, I was able to get this work done smoothly.
                                            Bulk enemy scripts were already created, so it was merely a task of dragging, dropping, and troubleshooting pre-existing
                                            systems.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Another small programming task I performed was the integration of projectile art. This involved a bit of troubleshooting
                                            the rotation of projectiles as they are instantiated. A snapshot of these tasks can be seen in the short clip below.
                                        </p>
                                        <video width="600" controls>

                                        </video>
                                        <p></p>
                                        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Finally, I helped the Project Bloom team a little with staff designs. This was a pretty straightforward task: for each
                                            weapon type, I created a quick sketch that visually represents the weapon in question. I had the opportunity to sit 
                                            in-person with Brandon Schulz and George Castle to discuss. The sketches can be seen below, and 3D models for each have
                                            made it into Project Bloom!
                                        </p>
                                        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Devblog/11-14-g.png" alt="" /></a>
                                        <p>
                                            Overall, I'm noticing a pronounced upswing for both Project Bloom and Project Tower. Project Bloom struggled with 
                                            earlier sprints, but the team has kicked it into high-gear and the game is making great strides. Project Tower has been 
                                            in a consistently good place thanks to the work of our members.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The final focus for Project Tower will be getting the rest of the narrative in, finalizing art, and making some final
                                            passes at balancing. We have 4 more weeks to give it our all before wrapping things up, and it looks like we'll have 
                                            something really great to show off in December.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I'm looking forward to giving a detailed postmortem on all my thoughts relating to WolverineSoft and WolverineSoft Studio 
                                            come my graduation from the club. Even more so, I'm looking forward to working hard in this final month! That's it for 
                                            this post - see you in 2 weeks!
                                        </p>
