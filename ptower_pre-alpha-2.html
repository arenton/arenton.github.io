										<h3>Studio-wide & Project Tower Meetings</h3>
										<p>
                                            Over the past 2 weeks, I've run 2 studio-wide meetings: 10/24 and 10/31. Once again, I have studio members pair up 
                                            to peer-playtest. I find that this is a more interactive way to ensure that all members are updated on the progress of
                                            both projects. After the studio-wide portion of the meetings, I run the Project Tower meetings. These usually run a
                                            little longer and consist of more discussion.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            During Project Tower meetings, I typically start off with standups (keep in mind that there are only 10 members, so this
                                            goes by quickly). I also have members share interesting feedback that they gathered from peer playtesting. In the meanwhile,
                                            I add their observations about the game to our sprint goals page. An example can be found
                                             <a href="https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/x/Z4X6AQ">here</a>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After this, I briefly playtest the latest build of Project Tower for all members to see. During this playtest, we quickly 
                                            gather additional notes and observations. With all that done, I create tasks in the backlog and assign them to individual
                                            members based on their preferences. For a smaller project, this meeting format has been effective.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Communciation with Members & Task Assignment</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This is fairly straightforward. I'm always joking that at any given point I have about 10 WolverineSoft-related pings
                                            in my Discord backlog. I spent a good amount of time this sprint both clearing things up and asking clarifying questions.
                                            Overall, communication in Project Tower is still very robust. It seems our initial momentum is slightly cooling down, which
                                            is to be expected.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Unfortunately, both playtests that were scheduled for the latter half of the sprint were cancelled. We did, however, have
                                            the opportunity to playtest with Jordan Ajlouni on Wednesday 10/20. As usual, we received great feedback.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Finally, like I mentioned before, I spent a great deal of time this sprint creating and assigning tasks. As usual, Nikhil
                                            and Crystal take care of programming and audio task creation respectively. While I define priorities and suggest tasks,
                                            those two are the ones directly creating Jira tasks for the two departments. It's a huge help. On my end, I largely focus on
                                            creating/communicating art and design tasks. It seems that members generally have enough to do to fulfill their hours 
                                            commitment. It's been a bit difficult getting members to let us know (before it's too late!) that they don't have enough to 
                                            work on. Regardless, it doesn't seem that this has been a big problem. An example of a few tasks in our Pre-Beta I sprint 
                                            can be seen below.
                                        </p>
