                    of the original Zelda game by Nintendo. This was programmed solely by me and one other
                    student as an assignment for EECS 494: Introduction to Game Design and Development. All art a
                    nd audio assets were taken from the original game.<br><br>
                    If you press "4" while in-game, you will be teleported to a custom level featuring a custom
                    mechanic that is not in the original game. This was designed by my partner and I. <br><br>
